# Tests for https://www.epam.com/
The tests are written for most UI elements at epam.com/*  that can possibly have problems.
If I find a way to use their api, I would add tests for it.

## General explanation
UI tests like the scroll element at the [main page](https://www.epam.com/) are tested. I add only 1 test per every type of element, assuming that they all use the same script and there is no reason to test them in every path.

## Future updates
Some of the UI elements are not tested yet, I'm going to add the tests in near future.

When I'm done with epam.com, I'll start writing tests for their other domens like https://training.epam.com/ and etc.

There is a TODOList which describes my current goals a bit more precisely.
